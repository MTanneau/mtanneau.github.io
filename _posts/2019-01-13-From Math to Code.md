title: From doing Math to writing code 
subtitle: Workflow and implementation tips
---

Whether it is for processing data or implementing algorithms, programming has become virtually ubiquitous in Operations Research and Machine Learning.
Yet, bridging the gap between theory and practice holds challenges of its own, which often take significant amounts of time and energy.

This tutorial provides implementation tips and good practices for typical research-to-engineering workflows in Operations Research and Machine Learning.
We start by discussing rationales for choosing which programming language and software to use.
The second part of the tutorial focuses on good practices and tools for writing code, with practical examples. These range from style guides to unit testing to version control (Git).
Finally, we provide some generic insights and tips on how to run numerical experiments.


## Outline

* [10-15min] Programming languages and optimization software
* [55-65min] Writing good code
  * Good practices
  * Version control (Git)
  * Unit testing
  * Profiling and optimizing code
* [15-20min] Running numerical experiments
  * Generic setting for experiments
  * Sanity checks
  * Reproducibility
